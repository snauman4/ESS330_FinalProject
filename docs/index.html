<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Water quality is an important environmental concern, especially in river systems that are affected by urbanization, rapid climate change, and stressors like pollution. These ecosystems provide crucial habitat for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms but remain vulnerable to anthropogenic activities, such as industrialization. This study explores how designated environmentally-protected areas affect the water quality of river systems in the U.S. Southwestern river basins. Using nearly 50 years of water quality data from the U.S. Geological Survey, we analyzed ten river sites using various statistical tests to assess long-term trends in daily streamflow, water temperature, and pH levels. Our results show that there are statistically significant differences between environmentally protected and unprotected sites for all three variables. Overall, unprotected sites have higher mean flow, warmer temperatures, and more alkaline pH levels compared to protected sites. Time series decompositions and seasonal patterns further confirm annual cycles across all sites, with greater streamflow variability and some fluctuations at unprotected sites. These findings indicate that protection status is generally associated with both chemical and physical differences in U.S. Southwest river basins. However, environmental protections alone are not a guarantee for better water quality. Our work has highlighted the need for more funding and consistent monitoring at unprotected sites to improve overall site-level management in our watershed systems.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Water quality is currently one of the most pressing environmental challenges across the globe, directly impacting both ecosystem and human health, along with biodiversity <span class="citation" data-cites="ahuja2021water">(<a href="#ref-ahuja2021water" role="doc-biblioref">Ahuja 2021</a>)</span>. Looking specifically at Colorado, there are growing concerns over the state of local river systems due to increased runoff and nutrient pollution <span class="citation" data-cites="ator2022effects">(<a href="#ref-ator2022effects" role="doc-biblioref">Ator, Miller, and Saad 2022</a>)</span>. These concerns call for a better understanding of how protection policies could help mitigate threats to water quality. While some laws and frameworks are in place to control pollution and other harmful factors, these protections vary in their ability to truly protect aquatic ecosystems <span class="citation" data-cites="macpherson2020human">(<a href="#ref-macpherson2020human" role="doc-biblioref">Macpherson 2020</a>)</span>. Conducting research on these river systems is crucial for aiding in future conservation policy, especially with increasing anthropogenic effects.</p>
<p>River ecosystems serve as habitat for many organisms and also provide economic resources. Despite this, they continue to be threatened by anthropogenic activities like agriculture and industrial development <span class="citation" data-cites="malmqvist2002threats">(<a href="#ref-malmqvist2002threats" role="doc-biblioref">Malmqvist and Rundle 2002</a>)</span>. To combat these threats, protected area frameworks like the National Parks have been introduced to preserve these ecosystems from further harm <span class="citation" data-cites="lawrence2011national">(<a href="#ref-lawrence2011national" role="doc-biblioref">Lawrence et al. 2011</a>)</span>. The study region for this project is the Southwestern United States, where there are multiple protected and unprotected areas, with four of our ten sites being in Colorado specifically. The selected river systems to pull both protected and unprotected site data from are the Cache la Poudre River here in Fort Collins, the Colorado River in Mesa County, CO near the CO-UT state line, the Santa Margarita River near Temecula, California, the Verde River below Bartlett Dam, AZ, and the Green River in Jensen, Utah. Many of these river systems flow through wilderness in addition to more developed, urban areas. Using two sites along the same river system will allow us to see how the water quality has changed over time in relatively similar conditions. This contrast will allow for a direct comparison to see how protection status affects water quality trends.</p>
<p>The topic of this project was driven by a growing appreciation for data-based policy and its increasing importance for environmental protection. By looking at rivers with both protected and unprotected areas, we hope to pinpoint the true effects that protective status has on water quality. Our motivation for this topic initially originated from the local significance of the Cache la Poudre River. Being Colorado State University undergraduate students in the Warner College of Natural Resources, we recognize the ecological importance and impact that the specific river system has on the surrounding areas. It is an essential water source for agriculture and also home to the local biodiversity, including both aquatic and riparian species <span class="citation" data-cites="fortcollins2008poudre">(<a href="#ref-fortcollins2008poudre" role="doc-biblioref">City of Fort Collins Staff 2008</a>)</span>. We then decided to expand our analysis to more river systems in the Southwestern United States to get more substantial results. Comparing different areas in the same river systems in this project provides the opportunity to see how protection status affects ecosystems against human and environmental impacts on a more local level.</p>
<p>In this project, we will be testing the hypothesis that areas designated as “protected,” due to endangered species, their location, etc., have stronger safeguards against various environmental stressors (i.e., pollution) than areas with no “protected” designation, leading to overall better water quality. We aim to test this hypothesis by looking at long-term trends in daily discharge flow rates (cubic feet per second per mile squared), water temperature (°C), and pH levels, as well as conducting various statistical tests to determine the statistical significance of the variables at each protected and unprotected site. We believe that combined, these three variables will give us an accurate evaluation of each site’s water quality over time.</p>

<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>As mentioned above, this study aims to examine whether environmental protection influences water quality within river systems across the Southwest River Basins. We began our project by visiting the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) spatial map on protected and unprotected areas within our study region to identify our 10 sites, 5 protected and 5 unprotected <span class="citation" data-cites="usgs_padus">(<a href="#ref-usgs_padus" role="doc-biblioref">U.S. Geological Survey 2024b</a>)</span>. We then went to the USGS National Water Information System for the complete water quality datasets for each site <span class="citation" data-cites="usgs_mapper">(<a href="#ref-usgs_mapper" role="doc-biblioref">U.S. Geological Survey 2024a</a>)</span>. We were able to select our ten monitoring sites across five major river systems: the Cache la Poudre River (CO), Colorado River (CO), Santa Margarita River (CA), Verde River (AZ), and the Green River (UT). These rivers were chosen for their varied geography, passage through both wilderness and urban environments, and ability to have accessible water quality data, allowing us to compare relatively similar ecological conditions within different protection statuses. All ten sites were selected to represent a mix of protected and unprotected conditions, with one site for each condition per river source for comparative analysis, and can be found on the USGS dashboard as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Protected Site (CO):</em> USGS 06752260, is located along the Cache la Poudre River in Fort Collins, CO, at an elevation of 4,940 feet, and is part of the National Wild and Scenic River with a drainage area of 1,128 sq miles.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Unprotected Site (CO):</em> USGS 09034250, Colorado River at Windy Gap near Granby, CO (Cache la Poudre flows into CO River - connection to unprotected Poudre site), at an elevation of 7,790 feet with a drainage area of 788 sq miles.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Protected Site (CO):</em> USGS 09163500, is located near the Colorado-Utah state line on the Colorado River in Mesa County, CO, at an elevation of 4, 325 feet, and is a part of the McInnis Canyon National Conservation Area, with a drainage area 17,849 sq miles.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Unprotected Site (CO):</em> USGS 09147500, is located on the Uncompahgre River in Colona, Ouray County, CO, at an elevation of 6,320 feet, and is not associated with any environmental protection, with a drainage area of 448 sq miles.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Protected Site (CA):</em> USGS 11044000, is located near Temecula, California in the Santa Margarita River. At an elevation of 955.88 feet, this site is a part of the protected landscape in the Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve, with a drainage area of 588 sq miles.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Unprotected Site (CA):</em> USGS 11074000, is located on the Santa Ana River below Prado Dam, CA, and is not associated with any environmental protection with a drainage area of 2,258 sq miles.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Protected Site (AZ):</em> USGS 09510000, is located near Verde, Arizona in the Wild and Scenic River below the Bartlett Dam and is federally protected with a drainage area of 6,161 sq miles.</p></li>

<p>From each of the sites listed above and seen in Figure 1, we obtained daily measurements of streamflow in cubic feet per second per mile squared, water temperature in Celsius, and pH levels from the daily data tab on the USGS National Water Information System. Our sites span a temporal range of up to 50 years, but our study focuses between 1975-10-01 (water year 1976) to 2024-10-01 (beginning of water year 2025), with water quality measurements available from the USGS National Water Information System. In this step of our analysis, we reached some issues regarding when data time frames were available for each variable, ultimately leading to our decision to have our temporal scope be set between the water year 1976 to the beginning of water year 2025. In addition to this, we decided to facilitate our analysis by coding our daily values - flow (cfs per mi²), water temperature (°C), and pH - to be aggregated into monthly means to be able to observe seasonal variation and reduce any short-term noise. Additionally, it was decided to standardize each site so that there was more of an apples-to-apples comparison with streamflow values. To do this, the streamflow values of each site were divided by the drainage area, allowing for a direct comparison of flow characteristics across watersheds of different sizes. This process normalized the flow data, making it easier to compare watersheds based on their flow intensity per unit area, irrespective of their size. All analyses were conducted using RStudio for visualization, statistical analysis, and mapping into figures.</p>
<p>To create decomposition graphs that are easier for visualization and conclusion, it was crucial to impute missing values in time series data to maintain the integrity of the analysis, especially when gaps in the data could distort trends and seasonal patterns. In this study, linear interpolation was used to fill in missing values, assuming that the missing data points are reasonably close to adjacent observations. This ensured a complete dataset, allowing for accurate seasonal decomposition. STL Decomposition (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess) was then applied to separate the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which helped to identify underlying patterns in the flow data. By isolating the seasonal effects, long-term trends, and random fluctuations, this method provided valuable insights into how flow changes over time. The imputation and decomposition steps enabled clearer visualization of seasonal patterns, such as annual flow cycles, and long-term trends, allowing for comparison between unprotected and protected sites. This approach not only improved the robustness of the analysis but also facilitated a deeper understanding of the environmental factors influencing the watersheds.</p>
<p>To quantitatively assess whether environmental protection status is associated with differences in water quality, we conducted the following statistical tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Three one-way ANOVA tests</em> were used to compare mean flow, temperature, and pH between protected and unprotected sites.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Three Welch Two-Sample t-tests</em> (not assuming equal variances) were performed to further examine differences in flow, temperature, and pH between protection groups.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Two Welch one-way tests</em> were conducted separately for protected and unprotected sites to evaluate variance in flow across different site locations within each group.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Two Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) post-hoc tests</em> were used for pairwise comparisons following the ANOVA, to determine which sites within each environmental protection group significantly differed from one another.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These methods allowed us to test for both overall group differences (ANOVA) and specific pairwise differences (t-tests and Tukey HSD), while accounting for unequal variances where applicable.</p>
<p>Overall, this mixed-methods approach, which included both temporal and spatial comparisons, exploratory data visualization, and a suite of statistical tests, provided a comprehensive framework to assess whether environmental protection status correlated with better water quality. These methods were selected to ensure replicability, statistical rigor, and alignment with our core research objective in determining how environmental protection status affects water quality within the U.S. Southwest River Basins.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="figure-2-6-panel-time-series-of-standardized-flow-temperature-c-and-ph-at-unprotected-and-protected-sites.">Figure 2: 6-panel time series of standardized flow, temperature (C), and pH at unprotected and protected sites.</h4>
<p>We first visualized monthly flow, temperature, and pH trends separately for unprotected and protected sites over the years of 1975-10-01 (water year 1976) to 2024-10-01 (beginning of water year 2025) in Figure 2. In the unprotected basins, the flow time series reveals substantial fluctuations, particularly in USGS sites 9505800 (West Clear Creek near Camp Verde, AZ), 09034250 (Colorado River at Windy Gap near Granby, CO), and 09147500 (Uncompahgre River, Colona, CO), with large peaks at different points over time, whereas the other unprotected sites remain relatively low and stable throughout the record. Protected sites show a similar seasonal pulse in flow (notable at 06752260 [Cache la Poudre River, Fort Collins, CO] and 09163500 [Colorado River near CO-UT state line]), but displayed lower values than the unprotected sites. Temperature time series at both unprotected and protected sites display pronounced annual cycles, with summer highs around 20–25 °C and winter lows near 0–5 °C. However, the timing and amplitude of those cycles vary by site based on elevation and location. The pH plots reveal tight clustering around neutral to slightly alkaline values (7.5–8.5 pH) across all sites, with only minor month‐to‐month fluctuations and no obvious long‐term drift.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="figure-4-subseries-showing-seasonal-trends-in-standardized-flow-at-protected-usgs-sites">Figure 4: Subseries showing seasonal trends in standardized flow at protected USGS sites</h4>
<p>Seasonal subseries plots break down each site’s flow into monthly panels. Both the protected and unprotected sites reveal either a clear pulse each in the summer or the winter months, with median monthly flows peaking higher than in the other months, with relatively tight variability across years. Unprotected USGS sites 09034250 (Colorado River at Windy Gap near Granby, CO) and 09147500 (Uncompahgre River, Colona, CO) display large peaks in the summer months (Figure 3). Along with that, the unprotected USGS sites 9505800 (West Clear Creek near Camp Verde, AZ) and 1107400 (Santa Ana River below Prado Dam, CA) exhibited large peaks in the winter months. The protected sites corresponding to its unprotected site location exhibited the same seasonal trends (Figure 4).</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="figure-6-decomposition-of-additive-time-series-at-usgs-protected-sites.">Figure 6: Decomposition of additive time series at USGS protected sites.</h4>
<p>The seasonal decomposition of flow data for both protected and unprotected sites shows distinct patterns across the four panels (Figures 5 and 6). In the top panel, the raw or observed data reveal considerable fluctuations in flow over time, with large spikes observed during spring and early summer months at both site categories (Figures 5 and 6). The second panel, which represents the trend component, highlights the overall long-term patterns of flow, illustrating gradual increases and decreases in flow that are likely influenced by broader climatic or environmental trends. In the third panel, the seasonal component captures the regular, repeating flow cycles, likely driven by seasonal changes such as snowmelt, precipitation patterns, and temperature fluctuations, with protected sites showing more uniform seasonal patterns. Lastly, the final panel, showing the remainder or residuals, captures the noise or random fluctuations that cannot be explained by the trend or seasonal cycles. These residuals demonstrate the unpredictable deviations from the expected seasonal flow, with the unprotected sites exhibiting greater variability in the flow compared to the more stable protected sites (Figures 5 and 6).</p>

<p>Across our full monthly dataset with the combined protected and unprotected sites, one‐way ANOVAs showed significant differences between protected vs.&nbsp;unprotected sites for flow (p &lt; 2e-16), temp (p = 4.32e-15), and pH (p = 1.1e-15). Welch two‐sample t‐tests confirmed that mean monthly flow was lower at protected sites (protected = 0.1539866 vs.&nbsp;unprotected 0.2705940 cfs, p &lt; 2e-16), while unprotected sites were warmer (unprotected = 15.46 vs.&nbsp;protected = 13.09 °C, p = 2.749e-15) and more alkaline/higher pH (unprotected = 8.33 vs.&nbsp;protected = 8.01, p = 1.364e-12). Within each protection class, one‐way ANOVAs of flow by site_no were also highly significant (unprotected: p &lt; 2.2e-16; protected: p &lt; 2.2e-16). In addition, the post‐hoc Tukey HSD table shows which specific pairs have a statistically significant difference in mean flow (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05), with the exception of unprotected USGS sites 9315000 (Green River at Emery County, UT) and 11074000 (Santa Ana River below Prado Dam, CA) (adjusted p-value = 0.9569) and protected USGS sites 9261000 (Green River near Jensen, UT) and 06752260 (Cache la Poudre River, Fort Collins, CO) (adjusted p-value = 0.828).</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>Our results show statistically significant differences in water quality through two of our indicators - water temperature (°C) and pH levels - between protected and unprotected river sites across the Southwest region. However, our flow (cfs per mi²) variable does not support our hypothesis as it showed lower streamflow levels at protected sites vs unprotected sites. Despite the flow being lower, the p-value is still under 0.01, so overall we <em>reject our null hypothesis</em>. Our analysis has supported this finding as the three one-way ANOVA tests that were conducted confirmed that protection status plays a statistically significant role in influencing these hydrological and chemical properties ( flow: p &lt; 2e-16; water temperature: p = 4.32e-15; pH = 1.1e-15). The second statistical test, the Welsh two-sample t-tests, we conducted also supported this through showing that protected sites showed a slightly lower average flow (0.1539866 cfs per mi²) than unprotected sites (0.2705940 cfs per mi²), as unprotected sites typically had higher water temperatures averages (15.46°C) in comparison to protected sites (13.09°C), and slightly more alkaline conditions (pH 8.33 vs 8.01). These results suggest that protection status is associated with both chemical and physical differences in the Southwest river basin systems. With that being said, it is also important to note that site-specific factors like elevation, local land, and drainage area contribute meaningfully to variability, as we saw in the Welch one-way test and Tukey HSD post-hoc tests that further confirmed that not all protected and unprotected sites are hydrologically equivalent.</p>
<p>The implications of our findings are great in the fields of ecology and conservation. While our analysis shows statistically significant differences in the water quality indicators in protected and unprotected sites throughout the Southwest region, it highlights issues in site-level management and local geography with how we interact with our watershed systems. Although in our study, protected sites were generally shown to be healthier, more balanced watershed systems, this result may be influenced by context-specific conservation strategies in addition to the assumption that a protection status alone is enough to guarantee healthy and quality river systems.</p>
<p>The limitations of our analysis have to do mainly with the data collection part of the project. Finding complete datasets that had enough daily data was more difficult than we originally planned. The process took about two weeks to find all ten protected and unprotected sites with multiple years of discharge flow rate, water temperature, and pH daily data. As seen in the result figures, most of the unprotected sites do not have pH data. In a way, this supports our hypothesis that protected sites have better regulations and get more attention than the unprotected sites, and along with that, receive more data collection focus. It was difficult to find unprotected sites that had all our necessary variables for this project, while it was relatively simple to find protected sites that met our requirements. Again, we believe this is part of the larger issue of unprotected sites not getting as much observation as the protected ones. Additionally, the timeline of many of the sites for each variable does not match up completely. As seen in the result figures, some sites may have temperature data from 1975 to 2024, while others only have 2023 to 2025, and so on. For the most part, this was not an issue, but it is something to keep in mind for comparisons because the data does not match up time-wise completely. However, there is enough data for each site and each variable to see overall long-term trends and make comparisons between the protected and unprotected sites.</p>
<p>Looking towards the future, there are many possible ways to bounce off our results for other projects. Given that we only looked at the Southwestern United States, an obvious stepping stone is expanding the study region to focus on other areas of the United States, and even around the world. Instead of just focusing on protected vs.&nbsp;unprotected river systems, we could also expand to other biomes, like rainforests, deserts, or grasslands. This could provide a broader framework to be used in future conservation plans and laws, not just helping river systems but also more ecosystems worldwide.</p>
<p>Our results relate to the broader field of science through showing that there needs to be more resources for protecting and managing parts of our ecosystems that are exposed more often to anthropogenic stressors, which affect the way they are able to function <span class="citation" data-cites="palmer2009climate">(<a href="#ref-palmer2009climate" role="doc-biblioref">Palmer et al. 2009</a>)</span>. This can also be seen throughout our data limitations throughout our whole journey in finding river sites that have data beyond simply discharge flow rates. Typically, unprotected sites didn’t have enough data due to a lack of monitoring, which only reiterates that more financial resources are needed along with prioritizing overall management of these river ecosystems <span class="citation" data-cites="major2021identifying">(<a href="#ref-major2021identifying" role="doc-biblioref">Major et al. 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Generally, environmentally-protected sites exhibit better water quality than unprotected areas within the same river system, indicating that protection status does affect key hydrological and chemical properties. However, it is essential to note that these differences in water quality are also influenced by gaps in the data and irregular monitoring. Improved resource allocation and site management are imperative across not only river systems but all ecosystems, regardless of protection status, to support future conservation efforts and strengthen ecological integrity.</p>
